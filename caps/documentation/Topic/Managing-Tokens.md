# Managing Tokens
In CAPS, anyone with Author permissions can easily create tokens, so CSI process aims to keep the workflow agile while avoiding duplicate or conflicting tokens. Each pillar team should have a token rep. who:

-   is informed when new tokens are created, to evaluate whether new tokens should be included in other portfolios.

-   periodically reviews tokens to double-check for duplication or inconsistency.

In XMetal, the **Insert Token** search will find tokens by name or by the definition, even with a partial term or wildcard. So, rigorous global naming conventions aren't required -- just make the token name reasonably descriptive and unique. You can see what each token resolves to via **Insert Token** or the token list in a CAPS portfolio.

If you want a new token, follow these steps:

-   Check the current list of tokens to see if a new one is needed.

-   If so, review your team's token guidelines.

-   Create the new token, and notify your team's token rep.

Currently, tokens are tied to a particular portfolio.  In the future, we'll be able to share tokens across portfolios (see [this feature](https://capservice.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/CAPS/_workItems/index)). Weâ€™ll also be able to see a list of all tokens and their text definitions at once, rather than one-by-one (see [this feature](https://capservice.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/CAPS/_workitems/edit/19464?fullScreen=false)).
