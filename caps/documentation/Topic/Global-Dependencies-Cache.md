# Global Dependencies Cache
The CAPS team maintains a global dependencies cache to facilitate reflection: as time goes by and the cache is populated, more and more common dependencies will be known by the system and not required for reflection.

The global dependencies cache is available in Phase 2, but the UI is not yet implemented. Until the UI is available, you can request that the CAPS mref team upload dependencies for you by filing a Task in the CAPS TFS.
