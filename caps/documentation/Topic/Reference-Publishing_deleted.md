Quick Overview of Reference Publishing

When publishing reference content there are three primary actions that can be take, Import, Authoring, and Content Publishing Online or Offline Build:
- Import: How your content gets created in CAPS. Typically this is the reflection process.
- Authoring: How your content get improved from the barest outline of syntax, parameters, and other automatically generated content pages. 
- Publishing and Build: How your content get to our customers, either through an on-line publication such as MSDN and TechNet, or through an off-line build, such as producing a word document or .chm file.
