# CAPS API Reference
An extensive API is available to programmatically work with CAPS, but it is not yet supported or documented by the CAPS team. Instead, the CAPS team has provided an [API Console](http://caps-api-console.azurewebsites.net/index.html#/api-list) to allow developers to browse the API. For access to the API Console, contact Steve Pyron or Megan Bradley, but please be aware that the Console does not constitute full API documentation and is not supported by the CAPS team. Steve's team can help with API investigations time permitting, but we cannot offer guarantees or an SLA.

That said, Steve and his team are already using the APIs to build internal tools, and they are documenting it here as they go. We are also filing requests to the CAPS team to indicate when we are taking a dependency on an existing API, or when we need APIs we cannot find, or when an API does not work as we need it to. The CAPS team has requested that we do this so they can focus the limited resources they have for API exposure on the APIs we actually need.

If you have API requests to make to the CAPS team, please send the following information in email to Steve Pyron:
