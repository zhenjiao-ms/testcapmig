# Quick/Full-text search
Quick search is a way intended to let you quickly find assets stored in CAPS (topics, arts, tokens, etc.) by simply typing in some words just like would you do in popular search engines, for example, Bing or Google. Use this functionality when you know the type of asset you are looking for, and you know at least part of the asset name.

Search only works for full words, no partial word. If you only know part of the name you are looking for partial name, use the advanced query functionality. See [Creating, Updating, and Managing Advanced Queries](../Topic/Creating,-Updating,-and-Managing-Advanced-Queries.md).

Search is case insensitive.

Search only works for English content.
