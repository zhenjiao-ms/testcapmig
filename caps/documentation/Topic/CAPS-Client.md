##<a name="NotificationCenter">Notification Center</a>##
We have a notification center to keep you infirmed on publishing progress and status, both to MTPS or offline.

It is located between the *Search by topic GUID* box and the **Settings** icon on the top right.

Once the publish is done, it would show a virtual hint indicating that the publishing job is completed. If you click on the notification center, you will see a list of all the notifications of actions taken by you. If you click on the any of the notifications, it will take you to the publish history section. 

On the top, you will see a summary of the total notifications that are unread as well as a summary of how many have succedded, failed, or have warnings.

Although initially the notification center only contains publishing information, it will be expaded to other areas like reflection, localizaiton handoffs, hand backs, et.
