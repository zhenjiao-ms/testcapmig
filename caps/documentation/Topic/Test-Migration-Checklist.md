# Test Migration Checklist
### Visual Inspection
After a test migration takes place the migrated English and localized content needs to be inspected in CAPS. Topics should be inspected to make sure that: 

1. Images appear as expected 
1. Links are rendered properly and still function 
1. Formatting of the topics is as expected 
1. Lists and tables are still intact 
1. Tokens are still valid 
1. Side-by-side content displays correctly (for SxS content only) 

Doc Sets and Outlines should be inspected to make sure that: 
1. The hierarchy of topics from all projects migrated as expected 
1. The form of the TOC is still intact (note: loc TOC could be a subset/different than en-US TOC) 

Topics should also be viewed in the sandbox environment to make sure they render properly by the build system. The same items listed above should be verified in the rendered topics as well.
