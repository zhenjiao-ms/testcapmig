# Creating Portfolios
The following guidelines summarize key considerations and steps for creating a new portfolio in CAPS. Contact your team's portfolio administrator if you need to create a new portfolio.

#### Steps for new portfolios

1.  Confirm that the content does not fit better in an existing portfolio.

    -   A portfolio is intended to be a logical container for grouping docsets that share the same product and version.

    -   The choice of portfolio location has no effect on TOC hierarchy or publishing; it is purely a convenience for grouping content.

    -   Docsets that share assets like tokens or art should be in the same portfolio.

    -   Choose carefully, because moving a docset to a different portfolio requires work from VSC.

2.  Choose a name for your portfolio.

    -   Generally use *Product|Service+Version* format for portfolio name (e.g. System_Center_2012).

    -   Avoid code names if possible. If you must use a code name, file a bug for VSC to change the portfolio name after an official product name is established. Inform localization of the change by emailing [ceic](mailto:ceic@microsoft.com).

    -   Avoid using cryptic abbreviations or acronyms based on org. names.

3.  Create the portfolio. See [Managing portfolios](../Topic/Managing-portfolios.md).

4.  Grant permissions, including artists as applicable. The Cloud &amp; Enterprise Intl Content Team - FTEs DL  ([ceic](mailto:ceic@microsoft.com)) needs Localization and Publishing permissions. See [Permissions](../Topic/Permissions.md).

5.  Inform localization about the new portfolio by emailing [ceic](mailto:ceic@microsoft.com).

For a list of existing portfolios, contacts, and related information, see [CSI Portfolios](../Topic/CSI-Portfolios.md).
