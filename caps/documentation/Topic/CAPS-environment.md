# CAPS environment
Once you open CAPS, you will see a **[!INCLUDE[Portfolio](../Token/Portfolio_md.md)]** section and all the projects you have access. A [!INCLUDE[Portfolio](../Token/Portfolio_md.md)] in CAPS should contain all the content for a given release. Click on any of the portfolios and you will see the following sections

## DocSet
A docset is a group of topics that share the same TOC or product family and version. A docset can either be Conceptual or Reference type. A docset can be linked by other docset for a complete TOC structure that matches what the customers see in MTPS. See [Managing docsets &#40;placeholder&#41;](../Topic/Managing-docsets--placeholder-.md).

Within a docset there are 3 sections:

1.  **TOC** represents the TOC in MTPS once published.

2.  **Not in TOC** contains topics that are not part of the TOC but they need to be available for customers.

3.  **Retired contents** contains those topics that are no longer available to customers (AKA "Pave Over"). See [Retiring conceptual content &#40;AKA Paving over&#41;](../Topic/Retiring-conceptual-content--AKA-Paving-over-.md).

## Query

## Trash
