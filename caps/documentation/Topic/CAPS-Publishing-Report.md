# CAPS Publishing Report
#PLACEHOLDER CONTENT#
Need to create a tool that can generate reports on publishing. A tool that can create an excel file with the data
 
This is the request to caps. But we need to make some now.
 
http://capsinsight.azurewebsites.net/Charts/PartnerDashboard.aspx?#usage_a
To allow more detailed data for publishing usage, we would like to be able to filter or extract data. If this cannot be done in the UI for the sake of keeping it simple, could we create a drill down page where we could filter more details?


I would like to see more here on this usage report, as follows:
Allow to select a date range for publishing data results
Allow to filter for English, or non English
Allow to select by portfolio for publishing data results


Error reports:
How many failures occurred
Drill down into what failed (mtps failures, content failures, etc)
show this data while allowing the other filters above for date range, language, portfolio)


If possible allow to sort/filter by any data, and export to excel option.
