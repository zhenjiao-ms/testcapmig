# CAPS office hours - index of recordings
Welcome to CAPS office hours! Once a week the CAPS reps and team host an open meeting to address tricky CAPS tasks and questions from users. We record these sessions - this article serves as an index of the videos to let you know what we talked about during each recording.

All recordings are available in: 
```
\\uafsall02\Public\CAPS office hours
```
 
 <br>Cut and paste that link, as markdown doesn't like to hyperlink it.

| Date and video name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| 8-26-15 - Retiring content      | **Retiring content**, but more specifically how to recover if you publish something you didn't mean to. How can you get it out of the TOC but still be able to work on it?|
| 9-03-15 - no recording     |We had a small group this week, so no recording. We discussed what happens when you publish live to MTPS - based on [this article](Understanding-publishing-to-MTPS.md). We'll cover this subject again, in the next session.|

<br>In addition to the videos mentioned above, we also have a share that holds nothing but training videos. If you were unable to attend a training session, check out the recordings:
