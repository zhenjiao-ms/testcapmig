# How do I fix issues in the pre-migration report?
The pre-migration report will call out types of issues that need to be fixed in order to migrate to CAPS. Most of these issues will need to be addressed in DX. 
* **P0** issues impact the migration and must be fixed
* **P1** issues may result in publishing failures
* **P2** issues may not be problematic, but owners should review these

See the navigation on the left for more information on each issue.

If you come across and issue that we don't have a page created for, please email [capsmigration](capsmigration@microsoft.com).
